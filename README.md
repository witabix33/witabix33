### Hi there üëã
üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on
**3D Printing stuff using openscad**
These are two small beginner's projects that introduced me to 3D printing.
They're not perfect, and I'll probably be suggesting improvements.

- **easter_rabbit** : 
It's a little 3D-printed rabbit that can be planted in a flowerpot.
The rabbit is based on a simple coloring drawing, modified to include a hole for the support foot. The foot can be a simple Chinese food chopstick.
- **phone holder** : 
C'est un support de casque de t√©l√©phone qui peut s'accrocher sur la paroi de s√©paration avec votre coll√®gue d'en face.
Le mod√®le openscad est param√©trable pour r√©gler les dimensions .
