### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
Some of these projects are NOT publicly available yet, but should be added soon.

## Old C stuff
I've found very old and simple, small C tools that could be usefull
Stuff to manipulate and extract data in old format files, like fixed size record files.

## 3D Printing stuff using openscad
These are two small beginner's projects that introduced me to 3D printing.
They're not perfect, and I'll probably be suggesting improvements.

| 3D model | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ![easter_rabbit](https://github.com/witabix33/witabix33/blob/main/easter_rabbit_x200.jpg) | [**easter_rabbit**](https://github.com/witabix33/easter_rabbit) Is a little 3D-printed rabbit that can be planted in a flowerpot. The rabbit is based on a simple coloring drawing, modified to include a hole for the support foot. The foot can be a simple Chinese food chopstick. | 
| ![phone_holder](https://github.com/witabix33/witabix33/blob/main/phone_holder_main_x400.png) | [**phone_holder**](https://github.com/witabix33/scad_phone_holder) Is a 3D telephone headset holder that can be hung on the partition wall with your colleague opposite. The openscad model can be parameterized to adjust the dimensions. |
